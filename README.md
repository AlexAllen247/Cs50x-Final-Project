# Cs50 Final Project

### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqYZCYwhFhs

## Description:

This project is a web application which is a homage/portfolio of all that I have learned during Cs50x.

Main Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Python
- Flask
- Jinja
- SQLite3
- Bootstrap

## How the Webpage works
#
### Register and Login

It first requires a user to register an account. The relevant fields are a username and a password. This web application's requirements are a unique username (i.e. one that has not been taken) and a password. The passwords must match or else an error message
pops up. Python was used along with the flask, functools and werkzeug.security libraries for the registration and the user was stored in a SQL database. Once a user is registered, then they can proceed to login.

### Backend

Python was the main language used for the backend. Flask is the web framework used to make the web application live. I also used Jinja to help replicate the HTML templates to make this application a multi page website.

### Index/About page

This is a HTML page describing the project. It provides links to all the projects and also my contact info.

### Quotes

This is a Random Quote generator. HTML is the base and Javascript was used for the interaction by clicking the button. This event changes the quote shown.

### Balls

This is a combination of HTML and Javascript. I used the canvas HTML tag to help create the animation. The script inside is all Javascript. The aim was to mimic my first project of Cs50x, which was a bouncing balls animation using Scratch. I provided the link to that project in the Index.

### Quiz

This is a quiz section where the base is HTML and the interactivity is Javascript. This was a homage to the Lab set 8 Trivia.

### Comments

This is a comment section where people can give their feedback, and it is instantly logged below. HTML, Python and SQL were used to input and display the data from the comments. The data is stored in a SQL database in the project directory.

### Styling

Some CSS was used, however the bulk of the style was Bootstrap. Some feel Bootstrap may give a simple design, however I like that. The simple design keeps the web application looking clean and professional. That is why I used it.

## Final Thoughts

Cs50x has been a thoroughly enjoying experience and I look forward to continuing by performing the Cs50W Web Application course. I hope to develop my skills further to build more complex and interesting projects.
